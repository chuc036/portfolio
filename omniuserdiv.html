    As a part of my accessories course in late 2019, we were asked to make a line luxury accessories.
    I wanted to create something that would bridge my interests in digital culture and visual presentation. With "Big Tech's" presence the united states, I felt like bringing the abstract concept of the web to a more physical form.
